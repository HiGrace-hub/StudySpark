StudySpark – AI-Powered Study Assistant

📌 Overview

StudySpark is a mobile-first web application designed to make studying smarter and more effective.

Instead of spending hours creating study materials, students can generate flashcards automatically, practice them with spaced repetition, and track their progress — all in one place.

This project simulates AI-powered flashcard generation for now, but in production it can be integrated with the OpenAI API for real-time summarization and quiz generation.

🚀 Features

✨ AI-Simulated Flashcard Generation: Convert notes or topics into Q&A flashcards automatically.

📝 Manual Flashcard Creation: Add your own custom cards to any deck.

🔄 Spaced Repetition System (SRS): Practice flashcards with proven memorization techniques.

📊 Progress Tracking: Keep track of studied cards and schedule reviews.

📂 Deck Management: Create multiple decks, switch between them, and organize your study sessions.

⬆️ Export & Import: Save your decks to a file or import existing ones.

📱 Mobile-First Design: Works smoothly on phones, tablets, and desktops.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Storage: LocalStorage (for decks & progress persistence)

AI (Simulated): Simple text-to-flashcard logic (OpenAI API can be added later)
